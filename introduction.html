        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I am an artist with a passion for painting and teaching. I specialize in creating vibrant and expressive artworks, and I love to share my knowledge and skills with others. In addition to my work as a painter, I teach arts and crafts to kids, helping them explore their creativity and develop their artistic abilities. My classes are designed to be fun, engaging, and educational, fostering a love for art in young minds</p>
